This is the the code in order for the Arduino to coexist with the color sensors, in order to interact with the antenna.

In this folder:
sketch_color_sens_sum_square.ino -> code for the color sensor to detect LED values (Red, Green, Blue, Purple)

sketch_rgb_led_cycle.ino -> code for circuit to cycle LED colors with a button (Off, Red, Green, Blue, Purple)
